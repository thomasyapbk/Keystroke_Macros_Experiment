# Introduction
This Python Keystroke Macro is being developed with the intention to explore the possibility of automating forms with predetermined outputs from excel. The process is built for purpose with my current project and may not work depending on the context of use.

## Imports
1. pyautogui
2. time
3. pandas
4. pathlib
5. os
6. openpyxl
7. datetime

**Note that we need to use pip installs for most of the imports. There may be issues with syncing this to use with group based security solutions**
